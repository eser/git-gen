You'll find a code snippet attached, which is the output of a git diff command. Please perform an efficient and concise code review that focuses exclusively on the newly added code, ignoring any removed sections. Highlight only the most crucial improvements that could be made to enhance the code quality, with an emphasis on common mistakes specific to the programming language and platform, rather than minor stylistic issues. The suggestions should follow best practices and be provided in a text-only, terminal-friendly markdown format. Do not include explanations for changes the author has already made; simply output the improvement suggestions as a response.
